# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
SQL PROJECT
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for a telecom company using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis is performed using SQL queries, exploring various aspects of customer behavior and identifying patterns that may lead to churn. The goal is to uncover insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information about customers, including demographic data, account information, services used, and customer status. By analyzing this data, we can understand the factors contributing to customer churn and suggest improvements based on the findings.

### Key Objectives:
- Identify patterns in customer behavior related to churn.
- Provide insights into potential improvements for reducing churn.
- Solve SQL-based problems to analyze and manipulate data effectively.
  
## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data.
- **Kaggle**: Dataset source.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## Problem Statements & Insights
- Solved 10-15 SQL queries related to customer demographics, account information, service usage, and churn.
- Provided percentage-based insights on improvements, such as how different factors (e.g., customer tenure, service usage) impact the likelihood of churn.

## Results
The analysis provided actionable insights into improving customer retention, including:
- Key demographic features contributing to churn.
- Insights into service usage patterns and their effect on customer loyalty.
- Recommendations for retention strategies based on the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning models to predict churn more accurately.
- Explore more advanced SQL queries for deeper insights.
- Build a dashboard to visualize churn trends and factors.
